# Description 
This is a simple program to run Pythia8 parton shower and hadronization with LHE input. 
Pythia8 parameters are in their default values, but the multiparton interactions (MPI) has been switched off.
The output file is HepMC2 format. 
You can edit your paths to **Pythia8** and **HepMC2** in the Makefile, and run
```
make 
```
to compile the codes.
